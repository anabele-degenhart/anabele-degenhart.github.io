The three words that describe me best are *available*, *resilient*, and *resourceful*. I am **available** in the sense that I am present in the moment, approachable, easy to talk to, and someone people can trust. For my children and my students just like in my research group or work team, I am always there, ready to help or get involved. I am **resilient** because I stay focused on my goals. I don’t give up easily, I remain persistent even when faced with setbacks and I never give up. Finally, I am **resourceful**. When a problem arises, I rely on my skills, I learn new ones if needed and I am creative in finding solutions.
